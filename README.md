# Embryonic-Mouse-Brain-Atlas
Ultra-high-resolution diffusion MRI atlas of embryonic mouse brains at E10.5-E15.5.
This dataset is assciated with the paper "A Spatiotemporal Continuum of Embryonic Mouse Brain Development Built on Diffusion MR Microscopy for Probing Dynamic Gene-Neuroanatomy" on PNAS.
The .gz files need to be unzipped to obtain .nii images.
